# GFG POTD Daily 🚀

Welcome to my **daily GeeksforGeeks Problem of the Day (POTD) journey!**  
This repository serves as a personal logbook where I push my daily POTD solutions.  
The main goal is to stay consistent, improve problem-solving skills, and strengthen Data Structures & Algorithms knowledge.

---

## 🎯 My Goals

- **Consistency**: Solve at least one GFG POTD every day.
- **Learning**: Deepen my understanding of algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques.
- **Quality Code**: Write clean, efficient, and well-documented solutions.

---

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each solution is stored in a separate file with a clear naming convention:

- `ProblemTitle`: The exact or simplified problem title from GFG POTD (camelCase).
- `.extension`: The programming language extension (e.g., `.java`, `.cpp`, `.py`).

Each file contains:

- A link to the problem on GeeksforGeeks.
- Problem difficulty (Easy / Medium / Hard).
- My approach + time & space complexity.
